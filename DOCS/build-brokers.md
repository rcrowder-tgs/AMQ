Q: write a bash script that will build 3 apache activemq artemis brokers using docker and set the ip to the container's ip address. Put them all on a network called amq-brokers.
```

Here's a Bash script that will:

1. Create a Docker network called `amq-brokers`.
2. Launch **three Apache ActiveMQ Artemis** broker containers.
3. Set each container‚Äôs **broker host name** to its **container IP address** inside the `amq-brokers` network.

Each broker will be:
- Based on the official `apache/activemq-artemis` Docker image.
- Named `amq-broker-1`, `amq-broker-2`, and `amq-broker-3`.
- Assigned a static IP using the Docker network if needed.

---

### üîß **`build-artemis-brokers.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Configuration
NETWORK_NAME="amq-brokers"
SUBNET="172.28.0.0/16"
IMAGE="apache/activemq-artemis"
BROKER_COUNT=3
BASE_IP="172.28.0"

# Create custom Docker network
echo "Creating Docker network: $NETWORK_NAME"
docker network create \
  --driver bridge \
  --subnet=${SUBNET} \
  $NETWORK_NAME || echo "Network $NETWORK_NAME already exists"

# Create brokers
for i in $(seq 1 $BROKER_COUNT); do
  CONTAINER_NAME="amq-broker-$i"
  BROKER_IP="${BASE_IP}.${i + 1}"

  echo "Creating broker: $CONTAINER_NAME with IP: $BROKER_IP"

  docker run -d \
    --name $CONTAINER_NAME \
    --hostname $CONTAINER_NAME \
    --network $NETWORK_NAME \
    --ip $BROKER_IP \
    -e ARTEMIS_USERNAME=admin \
    -e ARTEMIS_PASSWORD=admin \
    -e BROKER_HOST="$BROKER_IP" \
    $IMAGE \
    /opt/activemq-artemis/bin/artemis create /var/lib/artemis-instance \
      --user admin \
      --password admin \
      --allow-anonymous \
    && docker exec $CONTAINER_NAME /var/lib/artemis-instance/bin/artemis run
done

echo "All brokers created and running."
```

---

### ‚úÖ To run the script:

1. Save it to a file: `build-artemis-brokers.sh`
2. Make it executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x build-artemis-brokers.sh
   ```
3. Run it:  
   ```bash
   ./build-artemis-brokers.sh
   ```

---

### üìå Notes:

- You need Docker installed and running.
- This uses static IPs within the `172.28.0.0/16` range. Adjust as needed.
- Brokers are initialized and then run inside the same container.
- You can further customize persistence, clustering, or configuration through volumes and broker profiles.

Want to add clustering between these brokers too?

```
Q: create the docker-compose.yaml and Dockerfile to the create ubi9 containers the the brokers will be installed on. Then get the actual ip of container for the broker build. Call the build script from the Dockerfile
```

Great! Here's how to set up **ActiveMQ Artemis brokers inside UBI9-based containers** using **Docker Compose**, a **custom Dockerfile**, and a **build script that configures each broker using its actual container IP** at runtime.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Final File Structure:
```
artemis-cluster/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build-broker.sh
```

---

### üìÑ 1. `Dockerfile` ‚Äì UBI9 + Artemis Install + Bootstrap
```Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi

# Install Java and required tools
RUN dnf install -y java-17-openjdk curl unzip && \
    dnf clean all

# Download and extract Apache Artemis
ENV ARTEMIS_VERSION=2.31.2
RUN curl -sSL https://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/activemq-artemis/${ARTEMIS_VERSION}/apache-artemis-${ARTEMIS_VERSION}-bin.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /opt && \
    mv /opt/apache-artemis-${ARTEMIS_VERSION} /opt/artemis

# Add build script
COPY build-broker.sh /opt/build-broker.sh
RUN chmod +x /opt/build-broker.sh

# Entrypoint runs the build script
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/build-broker.sh"]
```

---

### üìÑ 2. `build-broker.sh` ‚Äì Runtime Container IP Setup & Broker Launch
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Set some vars
BROKER_NAME=${HOSTNAME}
ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"

# Get container's internal IP address
IP_ADDRESS=$(hostname -i | awk '{print $1}')
echo "Starting broker ${BROKER_NAME} with IP ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Create Artemis broker
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host ${IP_ADDRESS} \
  --name ${BROKER_NAME} \
  --silent

# Run the broker
exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üìÑ 3. `docker-compose.yaml` ‚Äì Launch 3 Brokers on `amq-brokers` Network
```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  broker1:
    build: .
    container_name: amq-broker-1
    networks:
      amq-brokers:
        ipv4_address: 172.28.0.2

  broker2:
    build: .
    container_name: amq-broker-2
    networks:
      amq-brokers:
        ipv4_address: 172.28.0.3

  broker3:
    build: .
    container_name: amq-broker-3
    networks:
      amq-brokers:
        ipv4_address: 172.28.0.4

networks:
  amq-brokers:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.28.0.0/16
```

---

### ‚úÖ How to Use

1. Create a directory and place the files inside:
   ```bash
   mkdir artemis-cluster && cd artemis-cluster
   # Add Dockerfile, docker-compose.yaml, build-broker.sh
   chmod +x build-broker.sh
   ```

2. Run the cluster:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Each container will:
- Use UBI9
- Install Java and Artemis
- Determine its IP at runtime
- Set it as the broker host IP

---

### üìå Optional Improvements
- Add `volumes` for persistent storage
- Enable clustering between brokers using `--clustered` and cluster config
- Health checks for broker readiness

Would you like me to help configure clustering between the brokers too?

```
Q: hostname is not valid on ubi9
```

You're absolutely right ‚Äî the `hostname` command behaves a bit differently in **UBI9** (and RHEL-based images in general). Also, depending on how the container is set up, `hostname -i` might not reliably return the container's IP.

Instead, we can reliably grab the container‚Äôs **internal IP address** using a method that works well with `ip route` or `ip addr`.

Let me update the `build-broker.sh` script for UBI9 and also tweak a couple of things so everything works smoothly.

---

### ‚úÖ Updated `build-broker.sh` for UBI9
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Use the container's internal IP
IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route get 1 | awk '{print $NF; exit}')

# Use the hostname as the broker name
BROKER_NAME=$(cat /etc/hostname)

ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"

echo "Starting broker ${BROKER_NAME} with IP ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Create broker instance
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host ${IP_ADDRESS} \
  --name ${BROKER_NAME} \
  --silent

# Run the broker
exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üîç Breakdown
- `ip route get 1` grabs the default route, which returns the interface used for outbound traffic ‚Äî perfect for Docker containers.
- `awk '{print $NF; exit}'` extracts the last field ‚Äî the container IP.

This is **more reliable** than `hostname -i` in container environments like UBI9.

---

### üí° Rebuild and Run
Once you replace the script:
```bash
chmod +x build-broker.sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Let me know if you want to add:
- Broker clustering
- Health checks
- Log volume mounts
- External access via mapped ports

I can help with all of that too!

```
Q: iprote gave the following
```

```bash
ip route gave
172.17.0.0/16 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.3
but 
IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route get 1 | awk '{print $NF; exit}')
did not get ip address 172.17.0.3 got 0 insted
```

Ah ‚Äî thank you for the detail. That output is key.

You‚Äôre right ‚Äî `ip route get 1` gives the full route, but `awk '{print $NF}'` isn't guaranteed to pull the correct IP in all setups. In this case, the IP is coming from the `src` field, not at the end.

Let‚Äôs refine the script to **directly extract the IP from the `src` field**, which is much more reliable across environments like UBI9.

---

### ‚úÖ Corrected `build-broker.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Get IP address from the route info (looks for 'src <ip>')
IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route | awk '/src/ { print $NF; exit }')

# Use container hostname as the broker name
BROKER_NAME=$(cat /etc/hostname)

ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"

echo "Broker name: ${BROKER_NAME}"
echo "Detected IP: ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Create broker
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host ${IP_ADDRESS} \
  --name ${BROKER_NAME} \
  --silent

# Run the broker
exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üß™ Example:
If `ip route` outputs:
```
172.17.0.0/16 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.3
```
Then `awk '/src/ { print $NF; exit }'` will correctly extract: `172.17.0.3`

---

### ‚úÖ To apply the fix:
1. Replace your `build-broker.sh` with this updated version.
2. Make sure it‚Äôs executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build-broker.sh
   ```
3. Rebuild the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Let me know if you'd like this IP wired into clustering setup or host mapping too ‚Äî happy to help with that next.

```
Q: include a file for the address and queues. The file format will have one address/queue per line.
```

Awesome ‚Äî let's add support to dynamically create **addresses and queues** from a file during the broker's bootstrapping process.

We‚Äôll use a plain text file (e.g., `queues.txt`) that contains **one address/queue per line**, and we‚Äôll use the `artemis address` and `artemis queue` CLI commands to define them inside `build-broker.sh`.

---

### üìÑ 1. `queues.txt` ‚Äî Example Format
This file lives in the same directory as everything else:
```txt
orders
invoices
shipments
dead-letter
```

Each line represents both:
- An **address**
- A **queue** (with the same name, bound to that address)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Updated `build-broker.sh`
This version reads `queues.txt` and creates the corresponding addresses and queues.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Get container IP
IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route | awk '/src/ { print $NF; exit }')

# Use container hostname as the broker name
BROKER_NAME=$(cat /etc/hostname)

ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"

echo "Broker name: ${BROKER_NAME}"
echo "Detected IP: ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Create Artemis broker instance
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host ${IP_ADDRESS} \
  --name ${BROKER_NAME} \
  --silent

# Add queues and addresses from queues.txt
QUEUE_FILE="/opt/queues.txt"
if [ -f "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    ADDR_QUEUE=$(echo "$line" | xargs)  # Trim whitespace
    if [ -n "$ADDR_QUEUE" ]; then
      echo "Creating address and queue: $ADDR_QUEUE"
      ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis address create --name "$ADDR_QUEUE"
      ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis queue create \
        --name "$ADDR_QUEUE" \
        --address "$ADDR_QUEUE" \
        --auto-create-address
    fi
  done < "$QUEUE_FILE"
else
  echo "No queues.txt file found at $QUEUE_FILE"
fi

# Run the broker
exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üì¶ 3. Update Your `Dockerfile`
Make sure the `queues.txt` file is copied into the container:

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi

# Install dependencies
RUN dnf install -y java-17-openjdk curl unzip && \
    dnf clean all

# Download Artemis
ENV ARTEMIS_VERSION=2.31.2
RUN curl -sSL https://archive.apache.org/dist/activemq/activemq-artemis/${ARTEMIS_VERSION}/apache-artemis-${ARTEMIS_VERSION}-bin.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /opt && \
    mv /opt/apache-artemis-${ARTEMIS_VERSION} /opt/artemis

# Add broker build script and queues file
COPY build-broker.sh /opt/build-broker.sh
COPY queues.txt /opt/queues.txt
RUN chmod +x /opt/build-broker.sh

# Entry point to bootstrap broker
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/build-broker.sh"]
```

---

### ‚úÖ Run it
1. Add a `queues.txt` file to your project directory.
2. Rebuild with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

Your brokers will start with addresses and queues like `orders`, `invoices`, etc., ready to go!

---

Want to allow more advanced definitions later, like separate routing types (anycast/multicast), DLQs, or topic-subscriptions? I can help extend the format for that too.

Awesome ‚Äî let‚Äôs upgrade your `queues.txt` format so it supports more advanced messaging configurations like:

- **Separate routing types**: `anycast` or `multicast`
- **Optional custom queue names**
- **Dead Letter Address (DLQ) setup**
- **Auto-create control**

---

### üßæ **Enhanced `queues.txt` Format**

Each line supports the format:

```
<address_name>[:<queue_name>][:<routing_type>][:<auto_create_address>]
```

- `address_name` (required): the address to create
- `queue_name` (optional): name of the queue (defaults to same as address)
- `routing_type` (optional): `anycast` or `multicast` (defaults to `anycast`)
- `auto_create_address` (optional): `true` or `false` (defaults to `true`)

---

### üìÑ **Example `queues.txt`**
```txt
orders
invoices:invoice-queue:anycast
shipments::multicast
dead-letter:DLQ:false
alerts:alerts-queue:multicast:true
```

---

### üîß Updated `build-broker.sh`
Supports parsing the enhanced format:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route | awk '/src/ { print $NF; exit }')
BROKER_NAME=$(cat /etc/hostname)

ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"
QUEUE_FILE="/opt/queues.txt"

echo "Broker name: ${BROKER_NAME}"
echo "Detected IP: ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Create Artemis broker
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host ${IP_ADDRESS} \
  --name ${BROKER_NAME} \
  --silent

# Add addresses and queues
if [ -f "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    entry=$(echo "$line" | xargs)  # Trim whitespace
    [[ -z "$entry" || "$entry" =~ ^# ]] && continue  # Skip empty or comment lines

    IFS=':' read -r address queue routing auto <<< "$entry"

    queue=${queue:-$address}
    routing=${routing:-anycast}
    auto=${auto:-true}

    echo "Creating address: $address (routing: $routing)"
    ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis address create \
      --name "$address" \
      --routing-type "$routing"

    echo "Creating queue: $queue (address: $address, auto-create: $auto)"
    ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis queue create \
      --name "$queue" \
      --address "$address" \
      --routing-type "$routing" \
      $( [[ "$auto" == "true" ]] && echo "--auto-create-address" )
  done < "$QUEUE_FILE"
else
  echo "No queues.txt found at $QUEUE_FILE"
fi

exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üì¶ Dockerfile Reminder

Make sure the `queues.txt` is still being copied:
```Dockerfile
COPY build-broker.sh /opt/build-broker.sh
COPY queues.txt /opt/queues.txt
RUN chmod +x /opt/build-broker.sh
```

---

### ‚úÖ Ready to Go

Just update your `queues.txt` to the new format and rerun:

```bash
docker-compose down -v  # remove old containers/volumes
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Want More?

Let me know if you want to support:
- Setting max consumers or filters
- Configuring DLQ + Expiry queues automatically
- JSON or YAML-based configs instead
- Declaring topics and subscriptions (e.g., JMS semantics)

We can make this even slicker.

```
Q: concatenate queues.txt into single command option line for the artemis create command that has each entry for address and queue separated by commas

--addresses $address:$routing
--queues $queue:$routing
```

Nice ‚Äî you're looking to **optimize Artemis broker creation** by preloading **all addresses and queues** into a **single `artemis create` command** using the `--addresses` and `--queues` flags. Super clean approach ‚Äî reduces the overhead of calling separate CLI commands after creation.

Let‚Äôs do it üí•

---

### ‚úÖ `queues.txt` Format (same as before)
```
orders
invoices:invoice-queue:anycast
shipments::multicast
dead-letter:DLQ:false
alerts:alerts-queue:multicast:true
```

---

### üß† Interpretation:

- `--addresses` wants:  
  `address1:anycast,address2:multicast,...`
- `--queues` wants:  
  `queue1:anycast,queue2:multicast,...`

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Updated `build-broker.sh` ‚Äî Batch Creation
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

IP_ADDRESS=$(ip route | awk '/src/ { print $NF; exit }')
BROKER_NAME=$(cat /etc/hostname)

ARTEMIS_HOME="/opt/artemis"
INSTANCE_DIR="/var/lib/artemis-instance"
QUEUE_FILE="/opt/queues.txt"

echo "Broker name: ${BROKER_NAME}"
echo "Detected IP: ${IP_ADDRESS}"

# Build address and queue args
addresses=()
queues=()

if [ -f "$QUEUE_FILE" ]; then
  while IFS= read -r line || [[ -n "$line" ]]; do
    entry=$(echo "$line" | xargs)
    [[ -z "$entry" || "$entry" =~ ^# ]] && continue

    IFS=':' read -r address queue routing auto <<< "$entry"
    queue=${queue:-$address}
    routing=${routing:-anycast}
    auto=${auto:-true}

    addresses+=("${address}:${routing}")
    queues+=("${queue}:${routing}")
  done < "$QUEUE_FILE"
else
  echo "No queues.txt found at $QUEUE_FILE"
fi

# Join the lists with commas
ADDR_ARG=$(IFS=, ; echo "${addresses[*]}")
QUEUE_ARG=$(IFS=, ; echo "${queues[*]}")

# Run Artemis create with addresses and queues pre-defined
${ARTEMIS_HOME}/bin/artemis create ${INSTANCE_DIR} \
  --user admin \
  --password admin \
  --role admin \
  --allow-anonymous \
  --host "${IP_ADDRESS}" \
  --name "${BROKER_NAME}" \
  --addresses "${ADDR_ARG}" \
  --queues "${QUEUE_ARG}" \
  --silent

# Run broker
exec ${INSTANCE_DIR}/bin/artemis run
```

---

### üìå Result

For example, your command will end up like this:
```bash
--addresses orders:anycast,invoices:anycast,shipments:multicast,...
--queues orders:anycast,invoice-queue:anycast,...
```

This eliminates the need to call `artemis address create` or `artemis queue create` after broker creation ‚Äî much faster and cleaner.

---

### üßº Pro Tips:
- Artemis will automatically create queues for matching addresses (with correct routing).
- You can later extend this to configure DLQs, expiry addresses, etc., via broker XML templates if needed.

---

Want to add dead letter and expiry queue support automatically for each queue too? I can show you how to wire that into the Artemis config.
